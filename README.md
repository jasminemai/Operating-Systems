# CSCI 340: Operating Systems
An introduction to operating systems principles with an emphasis on multiprogramming systems. Among the concept areas covered are real and virtual storage management, processor management, process synchronization and communication, IO management, and file management.

I am currently taking CSCI 340 as of fall 2016 and it is my most updated repository. :)
